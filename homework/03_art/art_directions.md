# Art using Java

**The goal of this homework is to practice the git commands and the basic structure of a Java program.**

In your assignments repo:

* Create a folder homework (if you did not do this in class)
* Go inside the folder homework, and create a folder 03_art. Inside this folder, you will write a Java file named Art.java.
* Your program should do the following:
    * Print your name "My name is YOUR_NAME"
    * Print your age "I am YOUR_AGE years old"
    * Print a message about your ASCII art "I am drawing a DRAWING_NAME"
    * Draw your ASCII art using System.out.println() - > Do something different from your classwork
