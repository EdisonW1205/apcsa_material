### Sorting Algorithms

* Create a file Sorts.java to implement your algorithms. You do not need to mp
* Your must work with an array. Do NOT use ArrayList.
* Method signature for bubble sort:  public static void bubblesort(int[]data)
* You can test your sort against the built in sort: Arrays.sort(ARRAY_PARAMETER)
* Test cases could be used by all algorithms.
* Test your work:
    - Make a random array
    - Make a copy of your random array
    - Sort one copy with your sort, sort the other copy with Arrays.sort()
     - Compare if those two arrays are now the same
