### Sorting Algorithms

* Create a file Sorts.java to implement your algorithms. You will need a Driver.java to run the algorithms.
* Your must work with an array. Do NOT use ArrayList.
* Method signature for Bubble Bort:
  
  ```
  public static void BubbleSort(int[]data)
  ```
* You can test comparing the output of your method with the result of the built in sort: Arrays.sort(array_here)
* Test cases could be used by all algorithms.
* Test your work:
    - Make a random array
    - Make a copy of your random array
    - Sort one copy with your sort, sort the other copy with Arrays.sort()
    - Compare if those two arrays are the same
